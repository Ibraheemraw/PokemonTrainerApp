# PokemonTrainerApp

## About / Synopsis

This is a pokedexApp that helps user's better to understand pokemon and gives them more information on the pokemon and their moves. you can save the pokemon that you see in your Pokedex. I came up with an idea that after the big news about ash finally getting a win. In the show Pokemon it stars him going on a journey meeting new people and pokemon to become a Pokemon Master. His drive to never give up is amazing. He has a high passion for pokemon, battling, and becoming the best version of himself I wanted to incorporate that type of philosophy into my passion for building apps. I am going to keep building apps like this that show off my passion and interests.
