## About / Synopsis

PokedexPro is a fanbase application that allowers users to better understand what kind of pokemon are out there, how strong they are and what kind of moves do they have. Pokemon has been a big discussion ever since the news went out about the anime character Ash Ketchum finally winning a championship. He has been working hard for 22 years to become a Pokemon master; building strong relationships with people and pokemon. I see a lot of myself in Ash because no matter how things turn out no matter how many times I fall I will get back up and try again until I get my win. He has a high passion for pokemon, battling, and becoming the best version of himself I wanted to incorporate that type of philosophy into my passion for building apps. So hopefully this app helps users get a feel of what pokemon is like and how much it has impacted my life.
